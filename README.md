# sql-challenge

## For Data Analysis Bootcamp at Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Monterrey.

Research project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. The database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this assignment, tables are design to hold data in the CSVs, CSVs are imported into a SQL database and data analysis is done.

* Some changes were done between schema.sql and EmployeeSQL.sql for interest purposes. =)
